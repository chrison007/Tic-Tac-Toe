1. Define the Rules:

Understand the rules of Tic Tac Toe. In a standard game, it's a 3x3 grid, and two players take turns to place their symbols (X or O) in empty cells. The player who successfully places three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.

2. Plan the User Interface:

Decide how you want to represent the game board in the console. You may choose to use a 3x3 grid or a different format. Think about how you'll display player moves and the current state of the game.

3. Set Up the Game Board:

Initialize the game board, which is typically a 3x3 matrix. You may represent it using a list of lists or another data structure.

4. Display the Initial Board:

Print the initial state of the game board to the console. This helps players understand where they can make their moves.

5. Implement Player Moves:

Create a mechanism for players to input their moves. You can use the console to prompt players for row and column numbers where they want to place their symbol. Validate the input to ensure it's a valid move.

6. Update the Board:

After each move, update the game board to reflect the new state. Ensure that the chosen cell is empty before updating.

7. Check for a Winner:

After each move, check if the current player has won the game. Implement the logic to check for three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

8. Check for a Tie:

Check if the game is a tie (i.e., no more empty cells) if neither player has won.

9. Switch Players:

Implement logic to switch between players after each move. For example, if Player 1 just made a move, it's now Player 2's turn.

10. Repeat the Game Loop:
- Wrap the player moves, board updates, winner checks, and player switching inside a loop that continues until there's a winner or a tie.

11. Display Game Outcome:
- After the game loop ends, display the outcome of the game. Inform the players whether there's a winner or if it's a tie.

12. Allow for Replay:
- Ask the players if they want to play again. If yes, reset the game board and repeat the game loop. If no, end the game.

13. Refine and Optimize:
- Review your code for readability and optimize where possible. Consider edge cases and handle errors gracefully. Add comments to explain complex sections.

14. Optional: Add Features:
- If you feel comfortable with the basic game, consider adding features like error handling for invalid input, a more user-friendly interface, or even an AI opponent for single-player mode.

15. Test Thoroughly:
- Test your game thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected. Try different scenarios to catch any bugs or unexpected behavior.

16. Optional: Share and Showcase:
- If you're proud of your text-based Tic Tac Toe game, consider sharing it with others. Showcase your project on code-sharing platforms or share the code with friends for feedback.
